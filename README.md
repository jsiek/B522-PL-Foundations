# B522 Programming Language Foundations

Indiana University, Spring 2020

In this course we study the mathematical foundations of programming
languages. That is, how to define programming languages and how to
reason about those languages and programs written in them.  The course
will use the online textbook

[Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/beta/)
(the beta version)

[Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/index.html) is a proof
assistant and a dependently typed language.  No prior knowledge of
Agda is assumed; it will be taught from scratch.  Prior knowledge of
another proof assistant or dependently typed language is helpful but
not necessary.
